🍏 **Objective:** Your mission is to consume the vibrant green food dots 🟢 to expand your serpent 🐍 while evading collisions with both the formidable walls and your own serpentine body.

💥 **Game Over:** The game reaches its gripping conclusion when you meet an untimely demise by crashing into a wall or yourself.
